        <p> Why do people need to travel in their lives? </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Travel can be a pleasure or a relief. People need to 
                relax to heal the wounds of life, so a change of scenery 
                isn't necessarily a bad thing. </li>
            <li> Travel can be informative. People see scenery they have 
                never seen in their lives or have never actually seen through 
                tourism, which satisfies the people's need for curiosity and 
                increases their knowledge. </li>
            <li> Travel can enlighten one's life. By going to places of historic 
                interest, people can often make us appreciate the man of the moment 
                in those days, and also inevitably have a new understanding and 
                experience of life. </li>
            <li> Travel can experience life or pursue romance. People always want 
                to experience the life they have never experienced. In addition to 
                tasting local famous food, watching special performances and so on, 
                you are experiencing life. </li>
            <li> Traveling can exercise your body. Some Tours are aimed solely at 
                exercising. Such as cycling around, etc. </li>
        </ul>
